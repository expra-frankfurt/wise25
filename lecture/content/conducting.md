# Conducting Experimental Sessions


## Being experimenter – What is important?
As an experimenter, your role is crucial to the success of a study. You're responsible for creating a positive experience for participants while maintaining the integrity and standardization of the experimental procedure. This ensures the data you collect is reliable and valid.

This guide will walk you through each stage of running a study—from recruiting participants to concluding the session—with practical advice to help you become a confident and competent experimenter.

### 1. Recruiting Participants
Recruitment is the first step in conducting an experiment. Your goal is to attract eligible participants while providing clear and transparent information about the study. Here are several examples of effective methods:  
- [SONA System](https://uni-frankfurt.sona-systems.com/Default.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2f), many psychology departments use this internal platform. It is a platform that allows researchers to advertise their studies and test students in exchange for monetary reimbursement or course credits (VPM). Participants can browse ongoing studies and choose sessions that fit their schedule.
- Posting flyers in approved areas around campus. 
- Posting study advertisements in university-specific groups or on departmental social media pages can be an effective and low-cost way to reach potential participants.

Remember to include all essential information in your recruitment materials:
- Purpose of the study (in general terms).
- What participants will do.
- Estimated duration.
- Eligibility criteria (e.g., age, native language, prior participation).
- Type of compensation (money, course credit, raffle entry).
- How to sign up or contact you.

```

### 2. Screening and Scheduling
Once someone expresses interest, check that they meet the eligibility criteria and set up their participation.
- **Screening**: This is a crucial step to confirm that a potential participant meets all eligibility requirements, such as age, specific experience, or their prior participation in similar studies. You can do this with a brief online form or a quick phone call. Examples: “Are you between 18–35 years old?” “Have you taken part in a similar memory study in the past 6 months?”
- **Scheduling**: After screening, you will schedule a specific time for the participant to come in. Be flexible and offer a few different time slots to accommodate their schedule. Confirm the time, date, and location (with directions if needed) of the experiment. Send a reminder email a day or two before their appointment.

Always be polite, professional, and responsive in your communication—this sets the tone for the session.

### 3.	Preparing for the Experimental Session
The experiment should run smoothly and consistently. Preparation reduces stress and mistakes.
- **Check the setup**: Test your software, hardware, stimuli, and timing in advance.
- **Have backups**: Print extra consent forms, keep spare pens, and save your task files on more than one computer.
- **Know your protocol**: Rehearse the procedure so you are confident.

### 4.	The Experimental Session
The session itself must be well-organized and standardized to minimize variability and potential bias.

#### 4.1 Greeting and Consent
- **Greeting**: Greet the participant warmly and thank them for coming. This helps them feel comfortable and respected. Briefly reintroduce yourself and the study.
- **Clarification and Consent**: Provide the participant with a **consent form**. Explain the study's purpose, the tasks they'll perform, and their rights as a participant. Emphasize that their participation is voluntary and they can withdraw at any time without penalty. Ensure they read, understand, and sign the form before beginning. Answer questions before they sign.
  
#### 4.2 Standardized Experimental Procedures
Consistency is the foundation of good science. Standardization is key to ensuring that every participant has the same experience, which leads to more reliable data.
- **Written protocol**: Use a detailed script that specifies what you say and do from start to finish.
- **Standardized instructions**: Always read instructions verbatim or provide them in writing. This ensures clarity and avoids unintended bias.
- **Automations**: Use software to present stimuli and record responses whenever possible. This reduces the chance of human error and ensures precise timing and data collection.
- **Anticipate questions**: Prepare standard answers for common questions participants might have. If you don’t know an answer, don’t guess—note the question and follow up later.
- **Experimenter training**: If multiple experimenters are involved, train them together. Have them practice the protocol on each other to ensure everyone is on the same page.
- **Randomization**: Make sure each experimenter tests participants in all conditions of the study. This prevents "experimenter effects," where a specific experimenter's behaviour might influence the results in one condition more than another.

#### 4.3 Instructions
Clear instructions are vital for a good experiment. If participants misunderstand the task, your data will be invalid.
- **Clarity and Correctness**: The goal is for all participants to understand the task in the **same way** and to understand it **correctly**.
- **Start from Scratch**: Assume the participant knows nothing about the experiment's procedures. Start with the basics and build from there.
- **Structure the Instructions**: The instructions should answer three key questions:
    1. What do I have to do? (e.g., "You will be asked to press the 'A' key...")
    2. How do I have to do it? (e.g., "...as quickly as possible when you see a green circle.")
    3. In what order? (e.g., "First, you will complete a practice round, then the main task.")
- **Allow for Questions**: After giving the instructions, ask if they have any questions and encourage them to speak up during the practice round if confused. Leave enough time for them to ask and for you to clarify. This ensures they feel confident before starting. 

#### 4.4 Experimental Log and Data Quality
Accurate documentation is just as important as the data itself.
- **Keep a Logbook**: Record participant ID, demographics, date, time, condition, and experimenter. Never use real names in your dataset—use anonymous codes.
- **Comments and Observations**: Include a section in your log for notes on unusual occurrences. This could be anything from a participant who seemed confused or uncooperative to technical issues with the equipment. These notes can be invaluable during data analysis.
- **Data checks**: After each session, verify that the data were saved correctly and back them up immediately.

#### 4.5 Concluding the Session
The final part of the session is just as important as the beginning.
- **Post-Study Questions**: Some studies include questionnaires or manipulation checks after the main task.
- **Debriefing**: Explain the true purpose of the study, especially if deception was used. Give participants a chance to ask questions. Provide a debriefing sheet if required by ethics.
- **Compensation**: Provide the agreed-upon compensation, whether it's money or course credit (VBM). Have them sign a form acknowledging receipt of their payment.
- **Farewell**: Thank the participant again for their time and contribution to your research. A polite and friendly ending increases the likelihood they will participate again.

### 5. Handling Unexpected Situations
Even well-prepared experiments sometimes encounter problems.
- **No-shows**: Have a clear policy (e.g., reschedule once, mark as incomplete).
- **Technical failures**: Pause the session, try to fix the issue, and if necessary, reschedule. Document what happened.
- **Participant distress**: If a participant becomes upset, stop the experiment immediately, offer support, and follow ethical guidelines.

## Final Thoughts
Being an experimenter is not just about running tasks—it’s about professionalism, ethics, and respect for participants. By preparing carefully, standardizing procedures, and treating participants with courtesy, you not only ensure high-quality data but also uphold the values of psychological science.
