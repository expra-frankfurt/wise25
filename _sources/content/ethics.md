# Ethical Standards and Data Privacy

## Why is ethics important? 
It is your study. It is your responsibility. 

Participants are individuals. Participants give you their valuable time. 

Treat them with care and respect!

## Treatment of participants
- [x]	**Voluntary** participation, no pressure whatsoever!
    -	Noone feels obliged to participate. There is **no monitoring** of those who refuse to participate. 
    -	Do not investigate children, patients, elderly, or other groups with **enhanced vulnerabilities** without consent of the ethics committee. 
    -	Participants need to be told that they will **not benefit** from participation. (Any payment is only a compensation.) 
    -	Noone is being **discriminated** against (i.e., there is no selection bias in recruitment). Tell participants from the outset who you are looking for and who will not be able to participate (for what reason?).
- [x]	Fully informed 
    -	**Text** needs to be well structured, easily understandable, with short sentences, written specifically for the participants. No technical jargon ("Fach-Jargon")!
    Consider showing a flowchart to illustrate the procedures. 
    -	**Why** is the study conducted? Scientific background. Do benefits outweigh the costs (i.e. costs for participants, not yours!)?
    -	**Who** is doing the study, where can participants get more information?
    -	**What** will be done? What do participants need to do (step by step)? 
    -	**How long** does it take?
    -	**Minimal deception**! Weigh costs against benefits. If deception concerns personal characteristics (e.g., performance feedback, personality trait scores), do by all means ask the ethical committee. Do not risk anything. 
    -	**Minimal burden**! Emotional and effort-wise! If there is any doubt, ask the ethical committee and/or consider a “trigger warning” or “disclaimer” before the experiment. 
    -	Always tell participants that they can **quit** at any time without providing reasons. Give them the compensation in proportion to the time that they have spent participating. 
- [x]	**Consent** (needs to be active, in the form of a check or signature, provide participants with printout or hardcopy of the consent form).
- [x]	Inform about potential **risks** (note, this is not in their interest, but also in yours, check examples below).
- [x]	Inform about background and study results **after participation** (this is often forgotten, which is not good... Do not treat your participants like a data delivery machine! They are individuals whose time and effort is valuable.)

## Data protection
- [x]	Differentiate anonymous from pseudonomous from person-related acquisition and storage of data
(**Anyomyisiert** versus **pseudonymisiert** versus **personenbezogene** Datenerhebung und -speicherung).
    -	If anonymous and without notable risk, no ethical approval is necessary.
    -	If pseudonomized, provide information on where the code list is stored and how it is protected and when it will be deleted (needs to be asap). Pseudonyms need to be really strong, but note that participants often make errors in generating codes themselves. 
    -	Inform participants that after deletion of person-related data, data cannot be deleted anymore even if requested. 
    -	If person-related info is recorded and stored, including video or audio or handwritten material, consider this material  particularly protect-worthy. It needs to be registered and monitored by the [Datenschutzbeauftragte of Goethe University](https://www.uni-frankfurt.de/111064324/Datenschutz). You also need a statement from the ethical committee (visit the [institute’s website](https://www.uni-frankfurt.de/141179107/Die_Gremien_des_Fachbereich_05) for more information on the local ethics committee). 
    -	Person-related data are names, addresses, email addresses, matrikel numbers; any information that might enable others (those who really try) to identify the person. Think of outliers, embarrassments; think of blackmailing, think of really nasty people and what they could do to one of your participants if they obtained their data).  
- [x]	Offer **deletion of individual data** whenever possible.

## Examples 
Here are some entirely fictional, but still realistic, examples of bad things that could happen when you take ethics lightly. Not to scare you, but to increase your sensibility. 
Ethical considerations are good for you. They provide a safety net. 

> In your study, you provide feedback on personality test results. You inform one participant that they have a percentage rank of 91% in paranoid thinking. The participant knew all along that no one would ever believe them, and takes this information as proof, so they jump off the next bridge to drown.

>	Your study is about learned helplessness. In one of your experimental conditions, participants are faced with jigsaw puzzles which are unsolvable, unknown to them. One particularly ambitious, but very modest participant (maybe an imposter) tried for almost one hour. They completed the study participation, but then drove home and exmatriculated from their studies because they were finally convinced that they do not belong at University. 

>	You show pictures from the IAPS in your experiment. There is one picture in the “sadness” condition of a cross on a hill. One participant who had just lost their son breaks down and cannot stop crying right in front of you. 

>	You are investigating the effects of sex on hemispheric asymmetries. You are excluding gay and transgender individuals from participation. Some students take this as offense and distribute flyers on campus to activate protest against your studies. The flyer states, among other things, that you assert a genetic foundation of sexual orientation like the Nazis did in the Third Reich.  

>	Your study is on the link between emotion regulation and family ties. One of your participants is the son of a very wealthy family in Frankfurt. An anonymous person blackmails the family by threatening them to publish the information their son had provided in your experiment about numerous romantic affairs of his father which his mother does not know about. You have no idea who the person could be and how they managed to obtain the information, but the institute is under enormous public scrutiny. 

> In your studies on visual motion illusions, one participant suffers an epileptic seizure and falls from the chair. They break their arm and suffer a concussion. They later sue you for their pain, suffering, and loss of study time.
