# Ethical Standards and Data Privacy

## Why is ethics important? 
It is your study. It is your responsibility. 

Participants are individuals. Participants give you their valuable time. 

Treat them with care and respect!

## Treatment of participants
✓ **Voluntary** participation, no pressure whatsoever!
-	Noone feels obliged to participate. There is **no monitoring** of those who refuse to participate. 
-	Do not investigate children, patients, elderly, or other groups with **enhanced vulnerabilities** without consent of the ethics committee. 
-	Participants need to be told that they will **not benefit** from participation. (Any payment is only a compensation.) 
-	Noone is being **discriminated** against (i.e., there is no selection bias in recruitment). Tell participants from the outset who you are looking for and who will not be able to participate (for what reason?).
    
✓ Fully informed  
-	**Text** needs to be well structured, easily understandable, with short sentences, written specifically for the participants. No technical jargon ("Fach-Jargon")!
    Consider showing a flowchart to illustrate the procedures. 
-	**Why** is the study conducted? Scientific background. Do benefits outweigh the costs (i.e. costs for participants, not yours!)?
-	**Who** is doing the study, where can participants get more information?
-	**What** will be done? What do participants need to do (step by step)? 
-	**How long** does it take?
-	**Minimal deception!** Weigh costs against benefits. If deception is personally relevant (e.g. performance feedback, personality trait scores, societal norms), do by all means ask the ethical committee. Do not risk anything. Take extra care when debriefing. Do not apologize, but explain why the deception was necessary and unavoidable. Ask participants afterwards if they still agree to have their data stored and analyzed, and invite them to question or discuss the procedures. A free entrance field will help you to monitor and evaluate any adverse effects and objections. 
-	**Minimal burden!** Emotional and effort-wise! If there is any doubt, ask the ethical committee and/or consider a “trigger warning” or “disclaimer” before the experiment. 
-	Always tell participants that they can **quit** at any time without providing reasons. Give them the compensation in proportion to the time that they have spent participating. 

✓ **Consent** (needs to be active, in the form of a check or signature, provide participants with printout or hardcopy of the consent form).

✓	Inform about potential **risks** (note, this is not in their interest, but also in yours, check examples below).

✓	Inform about background and study results **after participation** (this is often forgotten, which is not good... Do not treat your participants like a data delivery machine! They are individuals whose time and effort is valuable.)

## Data protection
✓ Differentiate anonymous from pseudonymous from person-related acquisition and storage of data
(**Anonymisiert** versus **pseudonymisiert** versus **personenbezogene** Datenerhebung und -speicherung).
-	If anonymous and without notable risk, no ethical approval is necessary.
-	If pseudonomized, provide information on where the code list is stored and how it is protected and when it will be deleted (needs to be asap). Pseudonyms need to be really strong, but note that participants often make errors in generating codes themselves. 
-	Inform participants that after deletion of person-related data, data cannot be deleted anymore even if requested. 
-	If person-related info is recorded and stored, including video or audio or handwritten material, consider this material  particularly protect-worthy. It needs to be registered and monitored by the [Datenschutzbeauftragte of Goethe University](https://www.uni-frankfurt.de/111064324/Datenschutz). You also need a statement from the ethical committee (visit the [institute’s website](https://www.uni-frankfurt.de/141179107/Die_Gremien_des_Fachbereich_05) for more information on the local ethics committee). 
-	Person-related data are names, addresses, email addresses, matrikel numbers; any information that might enable others (those who really try) to identify the person. Think of outliers, embarrassments; think of blackmailing, think of really nasty people and what they could do to one of your participants if they obtained their data).  

✓	Offer **deletion of individual data** whenever possible.

## Examples 
Here are entirely fictional, but still realistic, examples of some bad things that could happen when you take ethics lightly. Read below each example how an official ethical statement or, in fact, any discussion with third parties (i.e., independent panel of reviewers) can help. 

> Example 1:
> 
> In your study, you provide feedback on personality test results. You inform one participant that they have a percentage rank of 91% in “paranoid thinking”. The participant thinks to themselves that they had known all along that no one would ever believe them, takes the feedback information as ultimate proof, and jump off the next bridge to drown. 

→ In this extreme case, which hopefully never happens but is not entirely unthinkable, it would be invaluable to have an a priori statement from an ethics committee that your procedures are reasonable and justified. This would provide you with reassurance. It would indicate to law enforcement, relatives, the public, etc., that this extreme reaction could not have been anticipated. Above all, it would help you to manage potential feelings of guilt.

> Example 2:
> 
> Your study is about learned helplessness. In one of your experimental conditions, participants are faced with jigsaw puzzles which are unsolvable, unbeknownst to them. One particularly ambitious, but very modest participant (imposter…?) tries for almost one hour before they abort. They complete the study participation, but then drive home and exmatriculate from their studies because they are finally convinced that they do not belong at University.

→ This is a case where deception did the damage. If you deceive participants about personally relevant information, you are well advised to have a committee of ethical advisors check whether

1. Your study goals cannot be achieved without deception.
2. Your procedures ensure that your participants are carefully and fully debriefed (monitor this fact with an extra question that participants need to answer!). 
3. You invite participants to leave questions and concerns, in person or anonymously; and to get in touch with you for further discussion and information.  

> Example 3:
> 
> You perform a mood induction procedure in your experiment using the IAPS. In the “sadness” condition, participant see a picture of a cross on a hill and hear sad music. One participant who had just lost their son breaks down and cannot stop crying right in front of you.

→ The example is about a case that may have been prevented with a “trigger warning”. An ethical committee can advise you beforehand whether this may be required in your case. They might also recommend providing an address or phone number of psychological support services in the consent form (of which participants receive or can print out or save a copy) to ask for help if any adverse reaction occur during or after the experiment. 

> Example 4:
> 
> You are investigating the effects of sex on hemispheric asymmetries. You are excluding transgender and non-binary individuals from participation. Some students take this as offense and distribute flyers on campus to activate protest against your studies. The flyer states, among other things, that you assert a genetic foundation of sexual orientation like the Nazis did in the Third Reich.

→ Any document showing that your research question and procedures are considered scientifically justified and aligned with current standards by third parties in advance will help officials dismiss the accusations and put your mind at ease.

> Example 5:
> 
> In your studies on visual motion illusions, one participant suffers an epileptic seizure and falls from the chair. They break their arm and suffer a concussion. They later sue you for their pain, suffering, and loss of income.

→ See examples 1 and 3. 

> Example 6:
> 
> Your study focuses on the link between emotion regulation and family ties. Unbeknownst to you, one of your participants is the son of a very wealthy family in Frankfurt. Some time after your Expra, it becomes known that an anonymous person is blackmailing the family by threatening them to publish sensitive private information that the son had provided as a participant in your experiment (let this be about sexual orientation, marital affairs, sex travels or similar issues). You have no idea how anyone can have obtained access to your study data, but the blackmailer said that your study is in fact the source. The institute and your Expra supervisor are under enormous public scrutiny over how they handle data security.

→ This example illustrates the importance of data safety. Although it may feel like a rather tedious task, it is still very important. If you are not careful, you could face legal action. Using the checklist "Kurzantrag" of the local ethical committee (which you can find [here](https://www.uni-frankfurt.de/141179107/Die_Gremien_des_Fachbereich_05)) to check all relevant measures and have them confirmed by a committee can help motivate you to be conscientious, especially if person-related data are acquired and stored. Note also possible data protection breaches and violation of copy rights when commercial AI tools or panel providers are used.
