# Scientific Writing

In this section, we will discuss several general principles of writing scientific articles. We will focus on scientific reports as this is part of your assignment in the Expra, but many principles apply to other types of scientific writing as well (e.g., review papers, meta-analyses, commentaries, etc.).

Specifically, we will cover:

1. [Contents:](#contents) What information you should write about and where that information goes.  
2. [Language:](#language) How to express yourself in a scientific report.  
3. [Form:](#form) How to format your reports.  
     3.1 [APA style:](#apa-style) Standardized conventions for psychological articles.  
     3.2 [Figures and Tables:](#figures-and-tables) Standardized guidelines for the creation of figures and tables.  
     3.3 [References:](#references) How to cite other articles the easiest way.  
4. [Use of AI tools:](#use-of-ai-tools) Rules for using AI tools such as ChatGPT, DeepL, etc.  

## 1. Contents
This section is mostly based on an excellent paper by Mensh and Kording (2017) entitled [Ten simple rules for structuring papers](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005619). It is strongly recommended that you read this paper and follow the rules when writing your reports. You will find a summary of the rules below:  
  
  
<big>**Rule 1: Focus your paper on a central contribution**</big>  

When you write your paper, you should try to focus it on **one central contribution** your project is making (this can be a theoretical insight, a new method, a criticism of previous research, etc.). Try to make your claim as **simple** as your data and experimental logic allow and clearly communicate it in the **title of your paper** so that it is immediately clear what your paper is showing.  

A **good example** can be found in a paper by Aminoff and Durham (2023) entitled: *Scene-selective brain regions respond to embedded objects of a scene*. The central contribution is that scene-selective brain regions, which we usually assume to primarily respond to scene images, also respond to single objects. The novelty and relevance of this contribution are immediately apparent (the paper changes the way we think of these brain regions).  

Compare this to a title that only focuses on **what was done** in the project: *A comparison of neural responses of scene-selective brain regions to object and scene images*. While this gives the readers a good idea of the method that was used in the project, it does not communicate the contribution as clearly (what did they find?) and will not spark the readers' interest as much.  

Checklist for good paper titles:
- Should be **short** (10-15 words)
- **Avoid abbreviations/jargon**
- No question marks (**provide answers**, not questions!)

```{tip}
Formulate your title early on during (or even before) writing. This will serve as a reminder to yourself of the contribution you want to make and will guide you while writing.
```
  
  
<big>**Rule 2: Write for readers who don’t know your work**</big>  

Your writing should be clear and easy to understand for a **naïve reader** (a psychologist who is not from the specific field your project is located in). This includes defining specific/technical terms, avoiding abbreviations and acronyms (unless common, such as RT or ms) and, maybe most importantly, **making your readers care about your work** (why is it important?).

```{tip}
A good way to test if your writing is easily accessible is to have a fellow student from another Expra group read your manuscript. They should have a good understanding of basic psychological principles but will probably not know much about your specific field. Their feedback can be valuable in determining what parts of your writing need more explanation, justification or context.
```
  
  
<big>**Rule 3: The context-content-conclusion scheme**</big>

Your reports should tell a good "story". This does not mean that your writing should be lyric (see advice on language below), but your reports should start with a problem (the research question), then work on that problem and finally deliver a conclusion (a solution to that problem). This can be summarized in the context-content-conclusion scheme that can be found in the three major parts of each story: Beginning, Body and Ending. The Beginning sets up the **context** (problem) for the story, the Body provides the **content** of the story and in the Ending, the problem finds its **conclusion**.  

If either part is missing, you will get different responses from your readers. If you tell someone your story and their response is “Why was I told that?”, it indicates that your story did not provide sufficient contextual information in the beginning. If they are sceptical and ask “Why should I believe that?”, it indicates that the content in the Body was not sufficient to convince them. If they simply ask "So what?", they did not understand the conclusion provided in the Ending.
 
The context-content-conclusion scheme should be applied at different levels of your writing:  

**Paper level**: Your paper as a whole should follow the context-content-conclusion scheme. Your introduction provides context, your methods & results the content, and your discussion the conclusion. Note that you can also think of this as your paper following a **broad-narrow-broad structure (the “hour-glass structure”)**: The topics you will cover will first be very general at the beginning of your Introduction section, then become increasingly specific throughout your introduction and be most specific and relate to your project only in the Method and Results sections. In your Discussion section, you start specific again ("In this project...") and then become broader (relation to similar studies and theories, to the field as a whole, applications in everyday life, etc.), ending with a final summarizing conclusion.

![Image of the hour-glass structure with descriptions of what content is entailed in which part of the hour-glass.](../_static/Hourglass.png)   

**Paragraph level**: When writing individual paragraphs, you should also try to apply the context-content-conclusion scheme to guide your readers. The first sentence of each paragraph defines the topic (context), the body provides (novel) content and the last sentence provides a conclusion (see example below).
  
  <font color="red">Context:</font>One possible explanation for the counterintuitive effect of X we observe is that […] <font color="blue">Content:</font> Salinger (1951) relates this to […] Similarly, Heller (1961) argues that effect X may be the consequence of […] In contrast, Vonnegut (1963) proposes an alternative view in which effect X is independent of […] <font color="green">Conclusion:</font> In summary, all these accounts suggest that effect X may be reliable and not merely an artifact of our experimental design.</font>
  
  
<big>**Rule 4: Have a clear, logical flow of arguments**</big>  

Your writing should have both a clear structure (see rule 3 above and rules 6-9 below) and a logical flow of arguments. There are two simple ways to achieve this:

**Avoid zig-zag**: Each subject you cover should be covered only in one place and not, for example, in three different parts of your introduction. This also means that related arguments should not be interrupted by unrelated material (“zig-zag”). Instead, related sentences or paragraphs should be strung together so that the reader is naturally guided through your flow of arguments.

**Use parallelism**: Parallel messages should be communicated with parallel form (i.e., same syntax, same terms for same concepts). It is usually better to sound repetitive than to confuse people with different ways to refer to the same thing. This is especially important when using abbreviations (e.g., for conditions):
- **Bad**: “CON stimuli led to slower responses whereas inconsistent stimuli had lower RTs.”
- **Good**: “Participants responded faster to consistent compared to inconsistent stimuli.”
  
  
<big>**Rule 5: Tell a complete story in the abstract**</big>  

The abstract is a short (usually 200-300 word) summary of your report. After the title (see rule 1), the abstract is the second thing your readers will read, and for many readers it will be the only part of a paper they will ever read! It is therefore extremely important that it is clear, concise and convincing. Ideally, it should tell the complete story of your project while at the same time sparking your readers' interest and make them want to learn more. 

The context-content-conclusion rule and hourglass structure also apply to the abstract:  

**Context**: 
- Introduce the **broader field** (1-2 sentences)
- Narrow down the context to the **specific open question** you want to answer (the “gap”; 1-2 sentences) 
- Justify **why this question matters** (relate back to broader context you started with; 1 sentence)

**Content**: 
- Summarize the **method/experimental logic** you used to answer your question (“Here we…”; 1-2 sentences) 
- Present the **key results** (2-3 sentences)

**Conclusion**: 
- Interpret the results and **answer the question** you posed in the beginning (1-2 sentences)
- Show the **consequences of your findings** (with respect to theories, future studies, etc.; 1-2 sentences)
  
  
<big>**Rule 6: Introduction - Say why your paper matters**</big>  

The purpose of the Introduction is to identify the **gap in knowledge you seek to fill** and highlight **why it is important**. It should cover the following aspects:
  - Introduce the **general topic/field** (short) – Why is it important?
  - Summarize **current knowledge** of the field (findings, theories, models) – What is your study based on?
  - Establish the gap in the current knowledge – What is **still unclear**? 
  - Describe your project – What is the **question/goal of your study**?
  - Summarize your design, key results and conclusion – **How is your project “filling the gap”?**

In the Introduction, it is especially important to underline your arguments with **relevant citations**. When you make a claim (e.g., "Psychology students are very eager"), you must substantiate it with scientific articles supporting this claim. Claims that are not backed up by scientific evidence are merely opinions that may or may not be true and should be avoided. Additionally, you should ensure that you properly cite relevant work your project is building upon (e.g., related previous studies, a model or theory you are testing). But only cite articles that are directly related to your work! There is no need to impress people with the amount of literature you read, but it is important to show that you know the field and have understood the foundations of your project.

```{tip}
Remember to follow the **hourglass principle** in the introduction: From broad to narrow (or general to specific)!
```
  
  
<big>**Rule 7: Method - Provide enough detail for a replication**</big>  

The Method section should contain all information that your readers need to judge whether your experiment is suited to answer your question and to repeat your experiment (remember the replication crisis?). 

The Method section usually has its own subsections:
  - **Participants**: Who participated in your study (summary of demographic data such as mean age and SD, gender distribution, native language, population from which they were recruited, ethics, etc.)
  - **Stimuli/Materials**: Any materials you used while carrying out your study, for example stimuli that participants perceived, devices/software used to display stimuli and collect responses, questionnaires, databases, existing data, etc.
  - **Procedure**: What happened when (order of events), participants’ task(s) and instructions, trial structure
  - **Design**: Description of experimental factors/manipulations 
  - **Analysis**: Description of specific analysis strategies (not needed for simple/common analyses)

```{tip}
Have a look at similar papers (e.g., your supervisor's) and carefully read the method section. Things that need to be adressed: Assignment to experimental conditions (random?), between- or within-subjects design, counterbalancing of participants and/or stimuli, etc.
```
  
  
<big>**Rule 8: Results - Series of evidence supporting your claim**</big>  

When writing your Results section, it is a good idea to structure it into subsections (either only mentally or by using subheadings): Which statistical analysis is testing what aspect of your question(s)? When you have a clear structure, introduce the question each paragraph answers: _“We next tested whether…”, “After showing […], we next tested…”, “To ensure that there are no artifacts…”_, etc.  

If necessary, you can summarize your method/analysis strategy again as a reminder (e.g., if you are using an unusual design or category names/abbreviations). If possible, give an answer to each question at the end of the paragraph: “_We thus conclude that there are no artifacts of…_”, “_...a significant difference between conditions, indicating that our manipulation achieved the desired effect._”

In general, it is important to **summarize** both descriptive and test results, and **relate them to your hypotheses:** “_In line with the context hypothesis, we found…_” or “_…were faster which supports the notion of…_”.
  
  
<big>**Rule 9: Discussion - Was the gap filled?**</big>  

In your discussion section, you summarize your findings, critically relate them back to your hypotheses and the previous research, models or theories they are based on, outline possible limitations and avenues for future research and give your readers a final take-home message:
- Start by **repeating the main question** of your work, **how your project tried to answer it** (1-2 sentences on your method), the **key findings** and whether they **support your hypotheses**
- Highlight the main **contributions** of your work to the gap: **Relate your findings** to previous findings, theories, models, etc.
- Discuss **potential differences** between your findings and others as well as unexpected results and provide **reasons for these differences** (you can speculate here)
- Discuss **limitations** of your work (but do not make it look worse than it is!), remaining open questions and **implications** for future studies
- Show **how your work advances the field** or how it can be **applied** elsewhere (e.g., technology, societal impact)
- Draw a final **summarizing conclusion** (take-home message)
- Follow the **hourglass structure** (specific to general) in the discussion

```{tip}
The Discussion section is often critical for the final grade of your report. While much of the rest of your report is more or less determined by the project you are working on, the discussion is your chance to show how much you thought about the project, how well you understood its theoretical foundation and how well you are able to look at it from different angles. 
```
  
  
<big>**Rule 10: Test your paper on naïve readers**</big>  

A great way to test whether you followed the nine rules above is by having someone else (e.g., a fellow student from another Expra group) read your report and see what they think of it. Below you find typical reactions of your readers and how you can find out what you should work on to avoid these reactions:

| Rule | Sign of violation |
| --- | ----------- |
| 1. Focus on a central contribution | Readers cannot give a 1-sentence summary |
| 2. Write for naïve readers | Readers do not “get” the paper |
| 3. Use context-content-conclusion scheme | Readers ask why something matters |
| 4. Have a clear, logical flow of arguments | Readers stumble on small section of text |
| 5. Tell a complete story in the abstract | Readers cannot give an “elevator pitch” of your work after reading the abstract |
| 6. Introduction: Say why your paper matters | Readers show little interest in the paper |
| 7. Method: Provide enough detail for a replication | Readers can’t recreate your experiment |
| 8. Results: Series of evidence supporting your claim | Readers do not agree with your conclusion |
| 9. Discussion: Was the gap filled? | Readers are left with unanswered criticisms and/or questions on their mind |

## 2. Language

Scientific writing has the goal to convey information **as precisely and clearly as possible in as much detail as necessary using as few words as possible**. It should be objective and formal, but it should not be unnecessarily complicated or intellectual. Here are a few things to keep in mind:

- No colloquial language (e.g., colloquial expressions, abbreviations):  
    **Bad**: _We don’t think there is much of an effect, the test scores were pretty much the same._  
    **Good**: _We conclude that object size does not affect categorization speed as response times were not significantly correlated with object size._
  
- Write from your perspective (“We” or “I”) and use active voice if possible:  
    **Bad**: _Stimuli were manipulated to contain only low-level information._  
    **Good**: _We manipulated stimuli to contain only low-level information._

- Use verb tense consistently:  
  - Simple past for what you or others did: _We conducted an ANOVA… Kim (2015) showed…_  
  - Simple present for conclusions and generalizations: _We conclude that font size affects reading speed._

- Use clear, precise and objective language:  
     **Bad**: _Response times were roughly equal._  
     **Good**: _Response times did not differ significantly, t(48)  =  1.04, p = .304._

- Explicitly name variables you are assessing or comparing:  
     **Bad**: _We found no effect of working memory load._  
     **Good**: _We found no effect of working memory load on response times._  

     **Bad**: _Response times were shorter in the low-load condition._  
     **Good**: _Response times were shorter in the low-load compared to the high-load condition._
- Use **consistent terminology** for conditions, abbreviations, etc. in the **text**, **table** and **figures**!

- Use simple language – no need to sound smart!  
     **Bad**: _Participants experiencing chronic somnolence due to inadequate nocturnal rest demonstrated significantly diminished vigilance._  
     **Good**: _Participants who were sleep-deprived showed lower attention test scores._ 

- Avoid overly long sentences – try to break them up into shorter sentences:  
     **Bad**: _Although the experiment demonstrated that participants who engaged in mindfulness meditation reported lower stress levels and higher attention scores, it is not clear whether these effects would persist over a longer period or in a larger and more diverse population._  
     **Good**: _Participants who engaged in mindfulness meditation reported lower stress levels and higher attention scores. However, it is not clear whether these effects would persist over a longer period. Additionally, the effects require replication in a larger and more diverse population._

<big>**Guide your readers through your text**</big>  

While writing, consider not only the message you want to convey, but also the **information your readers need** to understand it (see rule 2 above). There should be a clear _**roter Faden**_ in your work, and **arguments should build on each other**. Certain **key words** make it easier to follow your train of thought:
  - _Here we…_ to identify your question, method, etc. and distinguish it from previous work
  - _We found…_ to identify your results
  - _We conclude/Our results indicate…_ to identify your conclusions and interpretations of the data
  - _We suggest/assume_… to identify suggestions (for theories, models or future work) or speculation
  - Connect thoughts with words like _however, similarly, surprisingly, in contrast_, etc.

## 3. Form

There are a number of formal rules that aim to standardize scientific writing and make it easy for readers to read scientific texts and find relevant information. The most important set of rules can be found in the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (more commonly referred to as "APA style"). A short overview can be found [here](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines).  

In your reports, you must always follow APA style. We will summarize the most important rules below. In case something is not covered here or you are not sure how to proceed, please refer to the 7th edition of the APA manual (can be found in the [library](https://ubffm.hds.hebis.de/Search/Results?lookfor=Publication%20Manual%20of%20the%20American%20Psychological%20Association&type=allfields&submit=Suchen)).

### 3.1 APA style

<big>**Purpose of APA style**</big>  

The purpose of APA style is to provide standardized writing conventions for the structure of empirical reports, for referencing other published works and for the creation of figures and tables. It is supposed to create a form that makes information easily accessible by providing mandatory rules for the writing of psychological articles. 

<big>**APA: Structure of your manuscript**</big>  
1. Title page (incl. title, author name(s), contact information, keywords)
2. Abstract
3. Introduction
4. Method
    - Participants
    - Materials
    - Procedure
    - Design
    - Analysis
5. Results
6. Discussion
7. References					
8. Appendix

Note that some subheadings may not be necessary in your project (e.g., the Analysis subsection).

```{important}
For your final reports: You must include a signed declaration of originality ([_Eigenständigkeitserklärung_](https://www.uni-frankfurt.de/100361739/BSc_MSc_FAQ___April_2021.pdf?#page=4)) at the end of your report! 
```

<big>**APA: Layout**</big>  

- For your reports: Times New Roman, size 12, double-spaced, left-aligned (no hyphens/manual breaks in words at end of line)
- Indent first line of each paragraph (except for the abstract) using the TAB key on your keyboard
- Differentiate [levels of heading](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/paper-format/headings) (note that font size is the same as the text!):   
![Examples for the first three levels of headings in apa format.](../_static/apa-headings.png)      
- The introduction has no heading; instead repeat the paper title as the heading
- [Page header](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/paper-format/page-header): Contains page number and running head (short title)
- [Title page](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/paper-format/title-page): In addition to APA style, provide your email and student ID number

```{tip}
Have a look at the [APA student sample paper and Word template](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/paper-format/sample-papers)
```

<big>**APA: Reporting test results**</big>  

- Use italics for letters used as statistical symbols: _t_ test, _p_ value, _R²_, etc.
  - But not for Greek letters: α, β, Χ², etc.
- Report exact _p_ values (e.g., _p_ = .019) unless _p_ < .001; no leading zero!
- Use reasonable number of decimals: 147 ms, mean rating 6.51, _p_ = .041
- Include test statistic, degrees of freedom, value, _p_ value, effect size
  - _t_ test: _t_(52) = 4.8, _p_ < .001
  - ANOVA: _F_(2,34) = 2.51, _p_ = .003, η² = .04
  - Correlation: _r_(357) = .42, _p_ < .001
  - Regression coefficient: β = -.34, _t_(225) = 6.53, _p_ < .001
- Narrative form: “A one-way ANOVA showed that noise had a significant effect on test scores, _F_(3,27) = 5.94, _p_ = .007, η² = .17. Participants in the low-noise condition yielded higher scores (_M_ = 23.6, _SD_ = 3.1) compared to the medium noise…”

### 3.2 Figures and tables

Figures (and tables) are among the **most important parts of your paper**! Many readers will read your title, maybe the abstract and then look at your figures before reading the main text. You should therefore invest time into making visually appealing, clear and informative figures.

**Method section:** You can use figures to show...  
  - (example) stimuli
  - the design of your study
  - an example trial sequence
  - the apparatus used in your study  

**Results section:**  
  - Use **figures** to visually showcase the **key findings** of your paper
  - Use **tables for large amounts of data** that would be too chaotic in a figure or when the exact values matter
  - Report values in the **text** if it’s just a few numbers (e.g., _t_ test results)
  - Do not report the same data multiple times (i.e., in the text, a figure and/or a table)  

APA style also has guidelines for the creation of figures and tables (see below). Keep in mind that figures and tables should (ideally) be **self-explanatory**, therefore it is important to choose a meaningful title and explain data, abbreviations, colours, etc. in the caption.

<big>**APA: Figure guidelines**</big>  
![This image shows a typical apa formated figure. Blue text fields highlight the different parts like figure number and short title, clearly labelled axes, etc.](../_static/apa-figure-guidelines.png)    

```{seealso}
APA [figure guidelines](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/tables-figures/figures) and [sample figures](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/tables-figures/sample-figures)
```

<big>**APA: Table guidelines**</big>  
![This image shows a typical apa formated table. Blue text fields highlight the different parts like table number and short title, test statistics in italics, etc.](../_static/apa-table-guidelines.png)    

```{seealso}
APA [table guidelines](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/tables-figures/tables) and [sample tables](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/tables-figures/sample-tables)
```

<big>**Use a plot type appropriate for your data**</big>  

<p align="left">
  <img alt="Left image: Plot with three colored bars that have the same mean outcome of approximately 50." src="../_static/example-plot-distribution1.png" width="60%">
</p>

Here is a little exercise. Look at the plot above and guess what the respective distributions of the data going into each of the three bars look like. If you want, you can copy the plot and draw some data points on it to indicate the distribution.

```{admonition} Click here to see the actual distributions of the data
:class: dropdown

<p align="left">
  <img alt="Left image: Plot with three colored bars that have the same mean outcome of approximately 50." src="../_static/example-plot-distribution2.png" width="60%">
</p>
```
As you can hopefully see, bar plots are not the best way to visualize data (for a number of reasons). An alternative to bar and box plots can be **violin plots**:

```{admonition} Click here to see violin plots of the same data
:class: dropdown

<p align="left">
  <img alt="Left image: Plot with three colored bars that have the same mean outcome of approximately 50." src="../_static/example-plot-distribution3.png" width="60%">
</p>
```

To create a violin plot in R, you can use the <code>geom_violin()</code> function within the ggplot framework:
<pre><code style="white-space: pre;">
ggplot(…) + 
  geom_violin()
</code></pre>

You can then play with visual appearance, layer points on top of the violins, etc.:
<pre><code style="white-space: pre;">
ggplot(…) + 
  geom_violin(colour = "white", fill = "grey",alpha = 0.3) + 
  geom_point(…)
</code></pre>

```{admonition} Click here to see violin plots with data points layered on top of the violins
:class: dropdown

<p align="left">
  <img alt="Left image: Plot with three colored bars that have the same mean outcome of approximately 50." src="../_static/example-plot-distribution4.png" width="60%">
</p>
```

<big>**A personal recommendation**</big>  

- **Invest time** into making visually appealing, easy-to-understand and clear result plots!
- Use **ggplot2** (part of the tidyverse package) for plot creation in R
- Choose a **plot type** appropriate for your data (e.g., violin plots)
- Use **colours** that are easy to distinguish (consider colour vision deficiency)
- Make sure that you **label your data clearly** (axes, legends, lines, etc.)
- Export your figures with a **high resolution** (at least 300 dpi) or as a vector graphic

<pre><code style="white-space: pre;">
super_cool_violin_plot <- ggplot(df, aes(x,y)) + 
    geom_violin(colour = "white", fill = "grey", alpha = 0.3) +
    labs(x = "Treatment", y = "Outcome") +
    theme_classic() +
    theme(legend.position = 'none')
    
ggsave(file = “violin_plot_file_name.png", plot = super_cool_violin_plot,  
     width = 16, height = 9,  
     units = "cm", dpi = 300, bg = "white")
</code></pre>

### 3.3 References

APA has strict [guidelines](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines) for referencing work by others. It is important that you **clearly distinguish between your own thoughts and ideas taken from other sources** and **explicitly name and credit these sources**. A failure to properly cite other work is considered plagiarism! 

```{caution}
Plagiarism in _Prüfungsleistungen_ will make you fail the exam, and in the worst case lead to your exclusion from the university!
```

<big>**When to provide a citation**</big>  

You must provide a citation for (1) **information** taken from other sources (e.g., research findings, statistics, facts, ideas, opinions, interpretations), even if you put the information in your own words, and (2) **tools and materials** you used (e.g., computer software, stimulus sets, graphics, analysis tools, R packages, etc.).

You **do not need** to provide a citation for information considered **common knowledge** (e.g., “We conducted an ANOVA” does not require a citation because ANOVAs are considered a standard procedure in psychology).

Note that in 99 % of cases, **citing means paraphrasing, not verbatim quoting!** Use verbatim quotes only if strictly necessary:

  _Horz and Rohrmann (2020) suggested that psychology is fun._  
  _Previous research shows that students enjoy statistics (Schultze & Schnatz, 2019)._  
  _In 2021, Fiebach’s seminal study on computer games showed that…_  
  _The authors concluded that the “Expra is the most underrated seminar in the psychology bachelor” (Wiesmann, 2025, p. 47)._  

<big>**Do yourself a favour: Use a reference management software!**</big>  

**1. Install software of your choice (we recommend [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/))**   
![Screenshot of an example Zotero bibliography](../_static/zotero-collection.png)  
You can just drag-and-drop PDFs into your collection. Zotero will automatically search for article information, but it is your job to make sure that all information (author names; year of publication; journal name, volume and issue; page numbers; DOI) is complete and correct!

**2. Install plugin for your text editor**  
![Screenshot of the Zotero plugin in word](../_static/zotero-plugin.png)    

**3. Tell Zotero to stick to APA style (7th ed.)**  
![Screenshot of a list of citation styles provided by zotero with the 7th edition of APA higlighted](../_static/zotero-apa.png)
