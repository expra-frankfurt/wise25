# Research Questions, Operationalization, and Hypotheses
A central part of scientific research is moving from a broad idea to a **clear, measurable, and testable plan**. This means being able to (1) formulate a strong research question, (2) define and operationalize abstract concepts into concrete variables, and (3) derive hypotheses that can be tested with data.
In this session, we will cover:
1.	[How to Formulate a Research Question](#How-to-Formulate-a-Research-Question)
2.	[From Concepts to Variables: Operationalization](#From-Concepts-to-Variables-Operationalization)
3.	[Developing Hypotheses](#Developing-Hypotheses)
 
## 1. How to Formulate a Research Question
A good research question should be:
-	**Feasible**: for example, we can begin to answer it with the resources and time available in EXPRA;
-	**Specific**: focused on a clearly defined phenomenon;
-	**Measurable**: connected to observable outcomes.

**Example**: Instead of asking “_Do emotions influence memory?_”, you could ask “_Do participants recall more negative or positive words in a free recall task?_”

## 2. From Concepts to Variables: Operationalization
Operationalization is the process of taking an abstract concept and turning it into something you can **observe and measure**.

Steps:
- Define your **concept** (e.g., “stress”),
- Identify a **variable** (e.g., heart rate, cortisol levels, questionnaire score),
- Specify your **measurement tool** (e.g., self-report scale, physiological sensor, behavioral task),
- Decide how you will **interpret results**.

**Example**:
- Concept: Stress
- Variable: Perceived stress level
- Operational definition: Measured by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)
- Interpretation: Higher scores indicate higher subjective stress

## 3. Developing Hypotheses
A hypothesis is a **testable prediction** derived from your operationalised research question. Hypotheses make explicit the relationship between variables.

Types of hypotheses:
- **Directional**: Predicts the direction of an effect (“_Stress reduces memory performance_”).
- **Non-directional**: Predicts a difference without specifying direction (“_Stress affects memory performance_”).
- **Null hypothesis**: Predicts no difference (“_Stress does not affect memory performance_”).
  
**Example**:
- Research question: _Does stress affect memory recall?_
- Operationalization: Stress measured with the PSS; memory recall measured by number of words recalled.
- Hypothesis (directional): _Participants with higher stress scores will recall fewer words than participants with lower stress scores._

This section prepares you for the next steps in EXPRA, such as the {doc}`literature`, where you will learn how to connect your research question to existing work in the field, and the later Data Analysis session, where you will test the hypotheses you developed here.
