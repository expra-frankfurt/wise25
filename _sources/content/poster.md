# Poster Design

> When creating your poster, remember: **a good poster doesn´t follow a recipe, it follows a purpose**. There is **no rigid blueprint** for a scientific poster, but a clear structure is essential to present complex content understandably (Burkhardt et al., 2017).


## Why are _good_ scientific posters important? 
(following Burkhardt et al, 2017)
-	Visual Communication & Simplification: Posters serve as a visual aid to clearly present complex scientific information and summarize research results concisely.
-	Discussion & Scientific Exchange: Their primary purpose is to stimulate discussions and encourage viewers to interact with the presenter.
-	Fundamental Competence: The ability to present one’s project understandably is an essential competence in academic studies and professional scientific fields. 

## What is a scientific poster and how is it structured?

> A scientific poster is a visual communication medium primarily used to summarize and present findings in an illustrative and concise manner, displaying one’s own research at conferences and in seminars. Its main purpose is to provide a clear overview of complex scientific content and to stimulate discussions. It achieves this by combining textual and visual elements, with the reduction of content to the essentials (Burkhardt et al., 2017; ISEK, 2014; Studierwerkstatt an der Universität Bremen, o. D.).

### Structure 
(following Burkhardt et al., 2017; ISEK, 2014)
**1.	Title & Authorship**
-	capture viewer’s attention
-	title = meaningful, attractive, concentrating on the project’s core message, formulated as a question or clear statement 
-	place names & titles of participating scientists, along with the logo of the institution / company they represent

**2.	Introduction**
-	place topic within a broader scientific context / current state of research
-	clarify key terms 

**3.	Methodological Background**
-	present materials & methods: self-explanatory graphics may help to illustrate experimental procedures
-	brief sample description

**4.	Results**
-	present findings of the research graphically, using diagrams, photos, schematics, etc.
-	visuals should be accompanied by short, explanatory text that summarizes the most important findings
-	aim: visuals speaking largely for themselves, requiring minimal text for understanding

**5.	Discussion**
-	interpret the findings
-	connect findings to broader theoretical and practical implications & future research 

**6.	References / Bibliography**
-	cite all literature to avoid plagiarism (APA format)

Wh-Questions to help structure your poster: 
(Studierwerkstatt an der Universität Bremen, o. D.)
-	WHO investigates
-	WHAT
-	HOW
-	with WHICH result
-	for WHICH aim
-	on WHICH basis?

## Design principles – 3 levels of engagement 
(following Alean-Kirkpatrick, 2002a, 2002b, as cited in Burkhardt et al., 2017)

> The following always applies to the design: avoid superfluous and disruptive elements (Studierwerkstatt an der Universität Bremen, o. D.).

### Look at me – attracting attention & first impression (ISEK, 2014)
> The initial impression is crucial, with the first 10 seconds often determining if your poster generates interest (Burkhardt et al., 2017).
-	divide poster into sections such as title, introduction, methodological background, results, discussion and references
-	white space is crucial to loosen up the poster & prevent overload
-	frames around text boxes are not necessary (if used, they should be fine lines, as bold ones may appear narrowing)
-	background images can make a poster illegible, a background in just one colour usually provides a greater contrast to the text
-	use of colours: 
  -	subtle & harmonious (too strong / bright colours may attract attention, but are tiring to read; soft colours radiate calm; dark / strong colours can appear restless; avoid colour gradients)
  -	putting information in the same colour may highlight their relation to each other 
  -	font colour should strongly contrast with the background (dark colours on a bright background are the easiest to read)
-	posters are typically in portrait format; DIN A0 (118.8 x 84.1cm) is the standard size in the ExPra, DIN A1 (84.1 x 59.4cm) may be used elsewhere
-	visual hierarchy guides the viewer´s attention, ensuring that key elements are seen first and the reading flow is intuitive rather than confusing (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x0SLtCVFho)
