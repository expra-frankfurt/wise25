# Data Analysis

Of course, the exact analysis you choose depends on your research question and the structure of your data. However, to support your independent work with R, [Dr. Sophie Nolden](https://uni-freiburg.de/edupsy/team/nolden/) (who used to teach EXPRA for several years but is now at Freiburg University) has developed a step-by-step tutorial specifically for thesis students at the LISCO Lab (Lifespan Brain and Cognitive Development lab, Goethe-University Frankfurt am Main). This guide covers common analysis steps such as data cleaning, descriptive statistics, assumptions checking, and basic inferential tests.

The tutorial is designed to:  

- Help you structure your analysis in a reproducible and logical way
- Encourage good coding practices and clear documentation
- Enance your confidence in using R for your own data
