# Data Visualization 

Effective data visualization is key to communicating your results clearly and accurately. If you're using R, a great place to start is the [introduction to ggplot2](https://pandar.netlify.app/lehre/statistik-ii/grafiken-ggplot2/) provided by [pandaR](https://pandar.netlify.app/). This chapter walks you through the basics of creating plots using ggplot2, one of the most powerful and flexible visualization packages in R.

In addition, the APA Style guidelines offer useful advice on how to format your figures correctly for academic writing. You can explore their guidance on [setting up figures](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/tables-figures/figures) and review several [example figures](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/tables-figures/sample-figures) to see how your visualizations should look on your posters and final reports.
