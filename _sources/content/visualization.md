# Data Visualization 

Effective data visualization is key to communicating your results clearly and accurately. If you're using R, a great place to start is the [introduction to ggplot2](https://pandar.netlify.app/lehre/statistik-ii/grafiken-ggplot2/) provided by [pandaR](https://pandar.netlify.app/). This chapter walks you through the basics of creating plots using ggplot2, one of the most powerful and flexible visualization packages in R.

## Which type of graph should I use?  
If you're not sure which type of graph best visualises your data, you can use this amazing [decision tree guide](https://www.data-to-viz.com/). Once you have made your decision, check the website https://r-graph-gallery.com/, that provides the underlying R code. 

## What is the correct format?
The APA Style guidelines offer useful advice on how to format your figures correctly for academic writing. You can explore their guidance on [setting up figures](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/tables-figures/figures) and review several [example figures](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/tables-figures/sample-figures) to see how your visualizations should look on your posters and reports.
