# Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)

Welcome to this lesson on **Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)**.

Ethical practice and rigorous research within psychology requires engaging with human diversity. This course addresses the necessity of integrating DEI principles into psychological science and practice.

We will provide information on foundational concepts and reflection points. **For each reflection question provided, please pause, take a moment, and answer it for yourself.** Personal reflection is the first step toward professional competence in this area.


## Diversity'

Ask yourself:

- What does Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion mean to you?

- What do you already know about the topic?

-  What is my definition of diversity?

- Which voices, perspectives, or identities are visible in my work space or private life—which are not?

- How do I react to people with different experiences, values, or backgrounds than mine and why?

- Which implicit biases might influence how I perceive diversity?

```{dropdown} Characteristics of Diversity
The presence of different (diverse) characteristics like
* age
* gender
* ethnicity
* skin color
* culture
* class
* disability
* sexual orientation
* religion
* Etc.

```


## Equity

Ask yourself:

- Do I have access to the same academic resources, mentorship, and networking opportunities as my peers—and is that true for everyone in my cohort?

- Where do I notice systemic barriers in academia or training that might disadvantage certain groups of students or researchers?

- Do I sometimes confuse “treating everyone the same” with “ensuring fairness”? How might this distinction play out in university settings or future clinical practice?

```{dropdown} Definition of Equity
Equity refers to the German term **"Chancengleichheit"** (equal opportunity); meaning that in a diverse society, every member should have the same chances independently of their characteristics.

```

---

## Inclusion

Ask yourself:

- What steps can I take to encourage classmates to share their perspectives without fear of judgment or exclusion?

- How do I respond when someone is subtly or openly excluded in academic or professional settings?

- Which everyday behaviors—in language, group discussions, or decision-making—can foster greater inclusion in my academic community?

```{dropdown} Definition of Inclusion
Inclusion means creating an environment where **equity and diversity can be realized**. It ensures diverse individuals feel **supported and can fully participate**.

```

## Professional Ethic: The Responsibility of Psychology

### Reflection Questions:
* In what connection do the topics of **diversity, equity, and inclusion** stand with your psychology studies and your future psychological work?
* Do we, as psychology students, bear a special responsibility regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion?

---

The intervention in and research of human experience are never without consequence; our actions inevitably influence the life realities of others. This responsibility begins within the university setting and runs through our entire professional life; it also influences our own perception, feeling, and actions. The decision to pursue a degree in psychology, regardless of whether the goal is treatment, research, or counseling, is therefore accompanied by an understanding of and, ultimately, a commitment to a **professional ethic**.

All major psychology associations point to this professional code. For instance, the Ethical Guidelines of the DGP (German Psychological Society e.V.; LINK) begin with a description of the ethical core attitudes of our field, which constitute a duty to respect the values of **diversity, equity, and inclusion**. Exemplarily, they require the following:

    *Original German Text:*
    PsychologInnen:
    (1) achten die Würde des Menschen und respektieren diese in ihrem Handeln;
    (2) erkennen das Recht des Einzelnen an, in eigener Verantwortung und nach eigenen Überzeugungen zu leben;

    Psychologists
    (1) respect the **dignity of the human being** and respect this in their actions;
    (2) recognize the right of the individual to live in **personal responsibility** and according to their own convictions;


In consequence, that diversity in lived realities, such as gender identity, sexual orientation, religious orientation, etc., should be recognized, and the free expression of these should not be restricted but rather **valued and supported**. Respect for individual dignity implies the prohibition of **all discrimination**. This will become even clearer in the following sections.

    *Original German Text:*
    Wir:
    (5) fördern Möglichkeiten der selbstbestimmten Persönlichkeitsentwicklung und tragen zur Gewährleistung fördernder Rahmenbedingungen bei;
    (6) fördern die Verständigung im sozialen Zusammenleben und den gegenseitigen Respekt;
    (7) handeln im Sinne des Wohls und Wohlbefindens der Menschen;
    (8) setzen uns ein für gute natürliche, sozioökonomische und kulturelle Lebensbedingungen von Einzelnen und Gemeinschaften;
    (9) fördern ein redliches Miteinander und gehen in unserem Handeln mit gutem Beispiel voran;

    We:
    (5) promote opportunities for self-determined personal development and contribute to ensuring supportive framework conditions;
    (6) promote understanding in social coexistence and mutual respect;
    (7) act in the sense of the well-being and welfare of people;
    (8) advocate for good natural, socio-economic, and cultural living conditions for individuals and communities;
    (9) promote an honest coexistence and lead by good example in our actions;



Equally, we are called to the social responsibility of our field:

    Psychologists
    (11) effect change in individuals, institutions, and society through reflection and an open exchange about attitudes, orientations, and images of humanity;

    *Original German Text:*
    PsychologInnen
    (11) bewirken durch Reflexion und durch einen offenen Austausch über Einstellungen, Orientierungen und Menschenbilder Veränderungen bei Einzelnen, Institutionen und in der Gesellschaft;


The declaration on social responsibility, such as the mission statement of the Goethe University (https://www.uni-frankfurt.de/leitbild) or the commitment to the Charta der Vielfalt (Diversity Charter - https://www.charta-der-vielfalt.de/) in 2011, emphasizes the necessity of scientific practice free from biased norms and societal statues. As psychologists, we are called upon not to close our eyes to unpleasant life realities and to **defend scientific findings** that aim at inclusion and equality.

    *Original German Text:*
    PsychologInnen:
    (16) orientieren sich bei neuen beruflichen Ansätzen und Methoden am Grundsatz wissenschaftlicher Redlichkeit, überprüfen systematisch die Wirkungen ihres Handelns;
    (17) sind wachsam gegenüber persönlichen, sozialen, institutionellen, wirtschaftlichen und politischen Einflüssen, die zu einem Missbrauch bzw. zu einer falschen Anwendung von psychologischen Kenntnissen und Fähigkeiten führen könnten;

    Psychologists:
    (16) orient themselves by the principle of **scientific integrity** in new professional approaches and methods, and systematically verify the effects of their actions;
    (17) are vigilant against personal, social, institutional, economic, and political influences that could lead to an abuse or misapplication of psychological knowledge and skills;


However, current sociopolitical changes, e.g. in the United States, show that these values are not necessarily progressively anchored in general society, and that cultural instituitons are currently confronted with an attack on diversity issues (such as the cancellation and prohibition of DEI topics in research funding or the restriction of research freedom). We are confronted with limitations between scientific and professional ethics and societal forces that seek to restrict the free development and social equality of minorities.

We are part of this society; the research work and therapeutic effects that we produce should serve the common good as well as the well-being of every individual. **Diversity, Equity and Inclusion** are central needs of our coexistence and we must be aware of their necessity and current standing.


## Self-Experiment - Do all of us hold Prejudices?

As we are part of society, we are not free from structural prejudices. The first step, here, is to become aware of one's own prejudices and attitudes.

**But How?**

Below you will find the link to a test with which you can test your attitude regarding topics such as sexuality, skin color, gender, and science, as well as ethnic background. See you soon!

### Reflections:

* Were you surprised by your results? If so, why? If not, why?
* Did the results prompt you to think, and if so, in what way?



## 1. Homogeneity in Psychology?

### Educational and Socio-Economic Backgrounds of Psychology Students:

### Reflections:
* What do your parents do for a living?
* How many of your friends are also students?

Take a look around your lecture halls. Our cohorts are often characterized by a certain social and cultural **homogeneity**, which stands in contrast to the pluralistic and changing overall society. For example, 58% of the total student body come from **academic families** (at least one parent with a university degree) (Deutsches Studentenwerk [DSW], 2021).

A survey (Booh, Huang & Westrich, 2019) shows that in the fields of Medicine & Psychology, the proportion of the total population coming from academic families is even **68.4%**.

This also correlates with differences in the social environment. 76.9% of students from academic families report that more than half of their social environment has studied or is currently studying. In contrast, this is true for only 33.3% of classmates from working-class families (Booh, Huang & Westrich, 2019).

Accordingly, this suggests not only a reproduction of the academic background, and thus often a maintenance of status, among most students, but also a **strong homogenization of the social environment**. **Children of non-academics**, in contrast, may perceive the social space of the university as rather alien. This perception **may be related** to a lack of **cultural capital** and less social support from their environment, which can lead to additional burdens and manifest itself in different perception and interpretation patterns of academic life (Büchler, 2012).


---

### Reflections:
* What does this mean for you?
* Which perspectives do you come into contact with daily?
* Are you prepared to identify and acknowledge cultural differences in therapy or research?
* To what extent are you in contact with people who represent different values than you? Why?

# What can I do right now?

Right, now for the EXPRA, you can already take a simple step by using **bias-free language**, as discussed, for example, by the **APA Guidelines on Bias-Free Language** ([https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/bias-free-language](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/bias-free-language)).

Furthermore, you can pay attention to **how you recruit your sample**, which **covariates** you collect to make diversity visible, and highlight the limited generalizability of results due to possible sample restrictions in the limitations and outlook section of your final paper.

 - SMART goals) -> 1: example for implementation

To prepare yourself on how to deal with this situation, you can plan directly using **SMART** (**S**pecific, **M**easurable, **A**chievable, **R**elevant, **T**ime-bound; Doran, 1981) to turn a goal like "managing a difficult conversation" into a concrete, low-threshold action plan.
SMART is intended to turn vague intentions into concrete action plans. In this context, it helps break down abstract commitments into measurable steps that can be practiced during an event like the family gathering, for example.

```{dropdown} Using SMART
You may be thinking: "I want to challenge my uncle's statement about political correctness, but I don't want to start a huge argument." This vague intention is emotionally taxing and rarely productive. Here's how you could break this down:

* **Specific:** Clearly defined (e.g., I will ask one open question about their concern).
* **Measurable:** Criteria for success review (e.g., I posed one question and refrained from debating/arguing).
* **Achievable:** Realistic and feasible (e.g., Asking one question is manageable).
* **Relevant:** Contributes to the overarching intention (e.g., Practicing active listening).
* **Time-bound:** Provided with a clear timeframe (e.g., During the family gathering this Saturday).
```

### 1. Generalizability of Psychological Research: The Problem of "WEIRDness"

Imagine a European research team is conducting a study on the efficacy of a cognitive-behavioral measure for the treatment of depression. They collect age, gender (male/female), educational background, marital status (single, married, divorced, widowed), and symptom severity at the start of treatment. Excluded are minors, individuals over 65, acutely suicidal individuals, individuals with an IQ < 75, and individuals with comorbidities. Participants are recruited through advertisements posted at the local university and its affiliated teaching outpatient clinic. The intervention is administered in person twice weekly during morning hours at the teaching outpatient clinic, which is located on the 4th floor. Access to the clinic entrance involves several steps, and no elevator is available.

---
### Reflections:

- To whom are the results of this study generalizable?**

- Who is likely excluded/not reached due to the framework conditions?**

---

Scientific psychology faces the challenge that a large portion of its findings are based on samples described as **WEIRD** (**W**estern, **E**ducated, **I**ndustrialized, **R**ich, **D**emocratic), limiting generalizability. These populations constitute only about 11% of the global population, yet account for 92% of studies from European and English-speaking nations (Newson et al., 2020). The age range of our convenience samples is often not even highlighted, yet it represents an additional factor limiting generalizability, particularly in university research (e.g., heavy reliance on undergraduate samples; 36% of samples in Psychological Science involved undergraduates (Martingano, 2023)). Even further, Western bias permeates scientific findings regardless of where the research is conducted; studies conducted in non-Western settings with non-Western participants are still dependent on an imbalance in power, which compromises scientific integrity and limits comprehensive understanding (Singh et al. 2022).


**Biased/Non-Representative Findings:** The dominance of "WEIRD" populations in research **carries the risk** of non-generalizable results that  inadequately reflect  the diversity of human experience and behavior worldwide (and even within Germany) (Henrich et al., 2010).

**Methodological Reorientation:** The **demand for a shift away from WEIRDness toward WILD (Worldwide, In Situ, Local, and Diverse)** research approaches emphasizes the necessity of culturally and contextually sensitive research practices. Only in this way can psychological theories claim generalizability or be adapted for specific populations (Newson et al., 2020).

# 2. Culturally Sensitive Diagnostics and Treatment in Practice

Germany's changing society, marked by increased migration and greater visibility of diverse identities, demands special attention in clinical practice. Psychologists and psychotherapists cannot afford to be blind to the specific life realities of diverse individuals.

**Etiology of Disorders:** The lived realities and causes of mental disorders vary significantly depending on origin, socioeconomic status, or experiences of forced migration (e.g., the increased prevalence and specific triggers of PTSD among refugees compared to the German general population).

**Gender- and Sex-Specific Aspects:** Even within the resident population in Germany, **differing prevalence rates and expressions of a mental disorder are evident depending on the specific condition** (e.g., in the case of PTSD in women and men) (Schäfer, 2019). These gender- and sex-specific expectations and differences in life experiences can influence the selection of a therapist, the therapeutic relationship, and the treatment goals and methods used.

**Culturally Sensitive Diagnostics:** Lacking knowledge of culture-specific characteristics and acculturation processes introduces the risk of misdiagnosis and ineffective treatment approaches. Psychologists must be capable of distinguishing culture-specific symptoms and personality patterns from actual pathologies.
