# General information on EXPRA

As EXPRA begins, we strongly recommend that you read the following information.

Please be aware that these guidelines are for all students across all EXPRA groups. If your teacher 

## What is EXPRA?
The “EXPRA” (German: Empirisch-experimentelles Praktikum) is a practical, hands-on
seminar designed to teach you the theoretical and especially the practical aspects of
psychological research. This includes (with varying emphasis in each group):

-  coming-up with a research question,
-  formulating hypotheses,
-  designing (and programming) an experiment to test these hypotheses,
-  ollecting, working with, and analysing data,
- presenting and discussing your research, and
- writing a scientific report on your project.

At the core of EXPRA is the idea that you work on a current research question in small groups
under close supervision by a researcher of that field. Very often, the experiment you are
carrying out will directly or indirectly feed into the work of the respective research unit. You will
thus not only learn to use psychological research methods but also gain insights into the
research currently carried out at your institute.


## What are the goals of EXPRA?
At the end of EXPRA, you should have learned how to

- critically read, search for and discuss scientific literature,
- design an experiment and “think like a scientist”,
- preregister your project,
- carry out psychological research,
- analyse and interpret data using R, and
- communicate your research projects in an oral presentation, scientific poster session,
and experimental report


## What do I have to do to pass EXPRA?

To pass EXPRA, you have to

- actively participate in the sessions and meetings with your instructors,
- carry out tasks required of you in time (e.g., reading literature, piloting the experiment,
collecting stimuli),
- preregister your study and make study materials available on LIFOS (see below),
- submit a demo report as a group (not graded),
- participate in experiments of other EXPRA groups (“collect 10 E”, see below),
- collect data for your project from fellow students, friends, family, flat mates, etc.,
- analyse your data using R,
- present your research results in one of the sessions, and
- prepare a scientific poster and present it to other students in the poster session.

Lastly, you’ll have to write a scientific report (the “**EXPRA report**”, see below) on your project.
This report will be graded and will determine your grade for the entire EXPRA (module
PsyBSc10).


## How many credit points will I get for completing the EXPRA?
You will receive 8 credit points (CPs) for successfully completing the EXPRA and submitting
an EXPRA report. Eight CPs equal 240 hours of work, meaning roughly 80 hours per month in
a three-month semester. The EXPRA is therefore among the seminars requiring the most work
in your bachelor, but you will get rewarded with a bunch of CPs and hands-on scientific
experience.


## Who can participate in EXPRA?
To be allowed to participate in EXPRA, you must be enrolled in a psychology bachelor’s
programme and have passed modules 1, 2 and 7 (PsyBSc1: Einführung in die Psychologie als
empirische Wissenschaft, PsyBSc2: Statistik I, PsyBSc7: Statistik II). **Students who took the
Statistik II exam (PsyBSc7) but haven’t received their grade yet may participate until the
grades are officially announced by the examination office. However, once the grades
are announced, those students who failed the exam cannot continue to participate in
EXPRA.**


## How do I share study materials via LIFOS?
As an exercise in open science practices, you are required to share your study materials via
[LIFOS](https://lifos.uni-frankfurt.de/users/sign_in) (local infrastructure for open science for psychology students at Goethe University). For more info on LIFOS see [here](https://pandar.netlify.app/lifos/main/). Note that sharing materials is part of the grading criteria. The deadline for uploading materials is the same as for submitting the EXPRA reports.

Specifically, you should upload:

- Your preregistration (filling out the template provided by LIFOS as a group; **mandatory**)
- Materials (e.g., stimuli you collected; **optional**)
- Analysis scripts (each student should upload their own analysis script; **mandatory**)
- Data (**anonymized**; one data file for the whole group unless you worked with different datasets; **mandatory** except for data that may not be shared for legal reasons, see [here](https://pandar.netlify.app/lifos/grundlagen/datenschutz-en/))
- Manuscripts (you may upload your own manuscript **after the EXPRA report submission deadline**; voluntary, manuscript **can be anonymized**)

## What is the EXPRA report and how is it supposed to look?
The EXPRA report is the final exam (“Prüfungsleistung”) you’ll have to write on your research
project. This report will be graded and will determine your grade for the EXPRA (module
PsyBSc10).

Each student writes their own EXPRA report on the research topic they worked on during the
EXPRA. Note that the EXPRA projects are usually carried out in groups, but each student must
submit their own, individual EXPRA report (no group work in the final reports, no identical titles,
figures, etc.)!

**The EXPRA reports must**

- be written in English (unless stated otherwise),
- be ca. 15 pages long (excluding table of contents, appendix, but including references),
- be formatted in Times New Roman, size 12, double-spaced,
- follow [APA Style](https://apastyle.apa.org/) (publication manual, 7th edition) if not stated otherwise,
- include a link to the preregistration (e.g., on [aspredicted](https://aspredicted.org/)),
- include an R script containing code of all analyses you carried out (this can be
submitted as a separate file along with the EXPRA report), and
- a signed (!) declaration of originality on the last page of the report (see below).

<font color='red'>To make grading of the EXPRA reports transparent, the grading criteria are attached to this
document.</font>

**The deadline for submitting the EXPRA reports is four weeks after the poster session.**
The exact date will be announced by your supervisor.

Students must register their EXPRA reports with the examination office (Prüfungsanmeldung
via QIS) and append a signed declaration of originality (Eigenständigkeitserklärung, for a
template see [FAQs by the examination office](https://www.uni-frankfurt.de/100361739/BSc_MSc_FAQ___April_2021.pdf?#page=4)).


## What is the DEMO report and how is it supposed to look?
As an exercise and preparation for the EXPRA reports, we ask groups of students (usually the
same groups working on an EXPRA project together) to submit a “demo report” on a demo
experiment carried out in class. This is usually a simple, well-established experiment in which
all students participate. Your instructor will then show you how to analyse and interpret the
data gathered in the demo experiment. Afterwards, you’re supposed to write a short scientific
report on that experiment (usually up to 10 pages, for other requirements see EXPRA report
above). This report is written as a group, and your instructor will then give you detailed
feedback on this demo report to avoid common mistakes when you write your final reports.


## What is the difference between the DEMO and the final EXPRA report?
- The demo reports are not graded, the EXPRA reports are.
- The demo reports are written as a group, whereas each of you must submit your own,
individual work for the final EXPRA reports!
- All demo reports are written on the same demo experiment carried out in your class.
The EXPRA reports will be written about the specific projects you are carrying out with
your tutors.
- You will receive extensive feedback on your demo reports to avoid common mistakes
when you’re writing your EXPRA reports. You will NOT receive feedback again on your
final reports before they are graded!


## Can I use AI tools to write code and reports in the EXPRA?
We generally allow the use of AI tools in the EXPRA to rephrase and review text (e.g., using
DeepL Write, Grammarly), translate text (DeepL Translator), search for literature and
summarize articles (e.g., Elicit), brainstorm on a topic (e.g., ChatGPT), writing code (e.g.,
GitHub Copilot) and image generation (e.g., DALL-E). Note, however, the following rules:

1. Your own contribution in writing the reports must exceed the contribution by AI (i.e.,
having an AI tool write entire parts of your reports is not acceptable).
2. You are responsible for the reports you submit – we strongly suggest that you double
check any output (text, code, etc.) created and sources cited by AI. An unreflective
use of AI is likely going to result in errors.
3. AI tools cannot be used as a citable source (i.e., “According to ChatGPT (2024),
priming is a psychological phenomenon…”). Any claims you make must be supported
by citations of peer-reviewed publications.
4. You must provide a list of AI tools you used at the end of your report (after the
reference list). This list should include:
    * Name, version and provider of the tool (company, organization or person that offers or programmed the tool)
    * Purpose of using the tool (e.g., translation, rephrasing, grammar/spelling check)
    * Affected text segments (e.g., “Discussion section” or “p. 14-15”)
    * Date of content generation
    * Address (URL of the tool)
5. In your declaration of originality (_Eigenständigkeitserklärung_), you must include the
following:
    >_I am aware that the use of machine-generated texts does not guarantee the quality of
    >content and text. I therefore declare that I have only used text-generating AI tools as
    >an aid and that my creative influence predominates in this work. Furthermore, I
    >declare that I have documented all text passages that were written with the aid of AI-
    >supported programs accordingly and provided a reference to the AI-supported
    >program used. I declare that I have not used any AI writing tools whose use the
    >examiner has explicitly excluded in writing._


## Where do I find EXPRA studies to participate in?
All EXPRA studies will be advertised on [SONA](https://uni-frankfurt.sona-systems.com/Default.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2f) and can be identified by the “[E]” tag at the end
of the study name. You will need a student account to access SONA and sign-up for studies
(contact [sona-support@dlist.server.uni-frankfurt.de](mailto:sona-support@dlist.server.uni-frankfurt.de) in case you forgot your account details).
You will receive credits ([Versuchspersonenminuten](https://www.psychologie.uni-frankfurt.de/157444303/VPM?)) for all EXPRA experiments. This will
automatically be taken care of by SONA.


## How do I collect the 10 E?
To ensure that all groups get the chance to collect enough data for their experiments, each
student is required to participate in experiments from other EXPRA groups (“collect 10 E”). To
do this, you will receive a 6-digit number code at the beginning of EXPRA. In each EXPRA
experiment (those identified with the “[E]” tag on SONA), you will be asked to enter this code
to count towards the 10 E. At the end of the semester, we check that all students participated
in EXPRA experiments and collected 10 E. Note that longer experiments and experiments
taking place on campus will be rewarded with more Es than shorter experiments and
experiments carried out online.

Note that you will of course still receive credits (Versuchspersonenminuten) in addition to the
“E” when you participate in EXPRA experiments. You can also participate in more EXPRA
experiments if you still need to collect VPM. Note, however, that you will also have to
participate in EXPRA studies even if you already finished collecting your 1800 VPM.


## Where do I get software required for the EXPRA?
You’ll need to have a current version of R and [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/#download) installed on your laptops to analyse
your data. See [here](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html) for an installation guide.

You’ll also need a presentation software and a design program of your choice to create your
scientific posters (PowerPoint does the job, but there are free alternatives like [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/),
[Scribus](https://www.scribus.net/), etc.).

We further highly recommend using a reference management software such as [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/), Citavi
([free as long as you are a student](https://www.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/literaturverwaltung/citavi.html)) or Mendeley for your reports. Most of these tools have
plugins for Microsoft Word which makes in-text citations and creating reference lists a matter
of a few clicks. Ask your instructor which software they use to get help.


## What knowledge is expected of me in the EXPRA?
Since passing statistics I ([PsyBSc2](https://pandar.netlify.app/lehre/main/#statistik-i)) and II ([PsyBSc7](https://pandar.netlify.app/lehre/main/#statistik-ii)) is a prerequisite for participating in the
EXPRA, **we assume that you have understood and can carry out basic statistical
analyses in R**. This includes (among other things) reading data into R, calculating descriptive
statistics, aggregating data, correlation and regression analyses, dependent and independent
sample t-tests, repeated-measure ANOVAs, and assumption tests for the different procedures.
If you need a brush-up for these topics, have a look at the PsyBSc2 and PsyBSc7 course
materials and work through them before the EXPRA begins. **Important: The EXPRA will NOT
include a repetition of basic statistics!** However, if you run into troubles using R, Martin
Schultze’s department is offering an “R Sprechstunde” for EXPRA students. More information
on this will be shared at the beginning of the semester.
